Predictably I first visited this website because of its interesting 88x31 button linked from [[camo93]]; it's a beautiful piece of artwork on its own and offers a glimpse into the design of the actual website.

I bookmarked wyvy because I wanted to collect its button for my button board _and_ because the website design is quite unique and as interesting as the button that lead me to it.

While not as large, or as sprawling as other personal websites I have bookmarked there is plenty of content to keep a visitor occupied albeit at the time of my visit, not updated since 2022.
