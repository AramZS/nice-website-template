I remember wanting to create something for this collaboration way back when I was working on my [[ Pixel Mainframe ]] artwork. I was however early into learning how to draw in the pixel art style and inevitably never got round to working on a submission.

It's good to see this project still visitable, even though it isn't linked from Kenneth's website anymore.
