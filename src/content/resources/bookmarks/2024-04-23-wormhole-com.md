Project Worm-Hole was a project by LinkMedia, the same people behind [The Inet Exchange Classified Directory](https://web.archive.org/web/19961106193142/http://www.inetexchange.com/). 

I found it via a link from [[Web Jail]] and it appears to have been a free link exchange of sorts. Members could register their website to be included in the worm-hole with the only requirement being that they include two banners on their website in return. 

One banner would link to the worm-hole website itself while the other would link to the _"Worm hole Jumper,"_ a cgi script that would redirect to one of the members randomly.

To that end this acted as a neat discoverability tool; similar to WebRings and Banner Exchanges that where popular in the early days of the Internet.
