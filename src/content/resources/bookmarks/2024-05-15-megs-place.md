I was delighted to discover this website for it exudes late 90s internet aesthetic, delicious! Discovered through their [[The Praetorian Pi|Praetorian Pi curio]] during a recent [[Digital Spelunking]] session it's chock-full of interesting pages.

I quite like Megs [button board](https://web.archive.org/web/20000816164336/http://www.megsplace.com/bb.html) page, this is unlike the 88x31 button boards you might have seen and is instead small round buttons that link to other websites.
