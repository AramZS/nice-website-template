During one of my deep, deep [[digital spelunking]] sessions I started noticing websites with 728x90 banners reminiscent of the old web. At the time I thought they were part of the retro aesthetic of the sites I visited until I noticed and subsequently clicked the `john` in the bottom right.

This is very similar to [[NavLink Ads]], with NavLink being more akin to the square ad format of Google ads.
