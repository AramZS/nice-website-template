The pixelated treeline background of this websites landing page looks similar to the one I found that inspired [my forest page](/forest/) and is primarily the reason why I have bookmarked it. 

I had been admiring Ronnie's rustic design and thinking I had not seen anything like it in a long time when I serendipitously saw this website linked from the links page of [[Ronnie's Strange Site]]. Not only does this have a similar aesthetic, it's self-described as an "internet cabin"!
