I first discovered this search engine via [their public data repository](https://github.com/MarginaliaSearch/PublicData) and am happy that I did so. Sometimes I feel as through I have [[Running out of Internet|run out of internet]] and finding projects like this help fill the void with interesting websites, especially with a neat little discovery tool wrapped up in a [random list of websites](https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random) page.
