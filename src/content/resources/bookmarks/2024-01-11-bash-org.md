Not having visited bash.org in over a decade I had long since forgotten about its existence until seeing [Derek Rodriguez's bash_irc_quotes](https://gitlab.com/dwrodri/bash_irc_quotes) repository [linked on lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/mtksdi/bash_irc_quotes_unoffficial_cleaned_irc). 

After several long outages over the decades it appears that bash.org has finally been laid to rest in the digital graveyard; the last capture on the internet archive was from July 19th 2023.

In addition to Derek's repository _The Archive Team_ has previously scraped the website as part of their [IRC Quotes scraping](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/IRC_Quotes); unsure if _this_ is theirs but [bash.org quotes as individual text files](https://archive.org/details/bash.org.txt) is available on the Internet Archive.
