In this wonderfully art filled web based game you collect seeds from a [_wild garden_](https://flowergame.net/flowers/wildgarden) and cultivate them in your green house until they are ready to be planted into your garden.

As far as I can tell you can collect up to four seeds and have to maintain their needs over a period of time in order for them to grow. 

I decided to give the game a go and have enjoyed the half an hour or so that I have spent playing it. I think the more people who visit a plants page the quicker it grows, so maybe give the below a quick click to help me out.
