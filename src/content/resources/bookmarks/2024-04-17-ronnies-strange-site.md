Their 88x31 button linked via the button page of [[puppygrass]] reminded me of the stamp styled button of [[Fishers Website: Glassy House|Glassy House]]. Upon loading their homepage you're hit with a very rustic, log-cabin theme. I don't think I have seen a website styled like this in a long time and I rather quite like it.

The homepage has a Trek themed Easter Egg and their [plane stats page](https://strangesite.neocities.org/planecounter) is quite unique. I recommend checking out [Ronnie's Gallery](https://strangesite.neocities.org/galleryfoyer) where they share a collection of their artwork for your eyes to enjoy.
