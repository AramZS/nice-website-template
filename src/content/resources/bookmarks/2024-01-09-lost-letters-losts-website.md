Lost's web-design at time of bookmarking is one of my favourite personal website designs so far. They have some nice collections of _webcore_ artifacts including a [Shrine to the Quilting Bee](https://lostletters.neocities.org/quilt/)! 

[[The Quilting Bee]] was one of the first online pixel-cliques that I discovered and was a big inspiration for my getting into pixel art and so seeing other people re-creating that atmosphere puts a big smiles on my face.
