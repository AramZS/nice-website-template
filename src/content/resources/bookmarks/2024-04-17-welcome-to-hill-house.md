I found Rosemary's website via [[Jeith's Website]] and I am glad that I did, it's a wonderfully designed, sprawling personal website which has obviously been built with a lot of care and attention to detail.

There is a lot to see and each page has a different design, yet every page feels like they belong together, from their [quotes collection](https://hillhouse.neocities.org/collections/quotes) through to their [scrapbook](https://hillhouse.neocities.org/scrapbook/).

[Rosemary's pixel clubs section](https://hillhouse.neocities.org/cliques) made me smile when I discovered their [Quilting Bee Shrine](https://hillhouse.neocities.org/cliques#quilt) inspired by [[Lost Letters, Lost's Website|Lost's]] [Shrine to the Quilting Bee](https://lostletters.neocities.org/quilt/). 

[[The Quilting Bee]] was a big inspiration for my getting into pixel art and it makes me happy to find others who appear to have fond memories of it as well.
