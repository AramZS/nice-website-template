While pulling the thread of [[The Praetorian Pi]] I stumbled upon this Banner Exchange being linked from [Catzy's Place](https://www.oocities.org/southbeach/lights/3630/). Having long since faded into digital dust this Banner Exchange served 468x60 banners and appears to have been free to join. 

From looking at the [bannercode.txt](https://web.archive.org/web/20010827103516/http://www.therumbles.net:80/bannercode.txt) document I can see that unlike the majority of other exchanges where the banner serving is handled client side by JavaScript, this exchange used [WebAds](https://web.archive.org/web/20001018221631/http://webads.bizservers.com/) a free, remotely hosted, banner/Ad rotation program.
