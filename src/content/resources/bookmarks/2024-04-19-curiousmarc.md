I began watching Marc's channel way back when they began their Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) Restoration video series and have enjoyed every video I have watched.

Marc's channel is well worth checking out if you're into vintage computing and electronics. They go into extreme detail while explaining things well enough that a layperson may both comprehend and enjoy the process.
