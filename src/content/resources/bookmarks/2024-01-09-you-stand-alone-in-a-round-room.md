This is a very cool #TextAdventure by [[Circuit Ghost]] that you can play in the browser. Unfortunately, it appears unfinished or at the very least broken. Following one path lead me to a dead end, while another lead to a 404 error page. This is the first HTML based text adventure I think I have played and I enjoyed what of it there is.

I do wonder how it was written, did the author write each html page separately or did they use some kind of static site generator to automate the process.
