I found Brandon's website via the about command of [[The H0NEYBRE4D Terminal]] giving special thanks to them for inspiration and was very happy to see another _terminal website_.

Brandon references this [video by `ForrestKnight~` on building a terminal website with hidden Easter eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtYby2QN0kQ) where Forrest builds [[FK Codes Terminal]] as their inspiration.

The source code is available on GitHub at: [bbkx226/terminalWebsite](https://github.com/bbkx226/terminalWebsite).
