There is a lot to see here with a wealth of interesting articles, shared bookmarks and more. The author fLaMEd appears to share many of my interests, therefore I have added Flamed Fury to my blogroll.

I recommend reading [An Easy Web](https://flamedfury.com/posts/an-easy-web/) and [A Simple Guide to Redirects on Neocities with Eleventy](https://flamedfury.com/posts/a-simple-guide-to-redirects-on-neocities-with-eleventy/).
