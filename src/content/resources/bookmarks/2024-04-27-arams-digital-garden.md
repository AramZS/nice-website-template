Aram asked me in November 2023 if it would be okay to use the source code of PhotoGabble's templates as a starting point for their own website, I was flattered to be asked and gave by blessing (although the licensing doesn't require it.)

Now, 2024 they circled back to share with me what they had created, and I am impressed. It fills me with joy to see others benefit from my work and that's at good fraction of _why_ I publish so much open source but also in this case it's interesting to see how Aram has branched off from the PhotoGabble template. I am proud to have been Aram's starting point for this project and wish them every success.
