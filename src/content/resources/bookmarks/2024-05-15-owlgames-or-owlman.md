This is an archive of Doom-files collected by OwlMan, I thought this nifty, especially the #TextMode theme.

I stumbled across this webpage while trying to find some details about [[Daniels Network]], my internet search lead me to a subdomain of [[NeoZones]] that no longer appears to exist and I found [[OwlMan's Website|OwlMan's Neocities Website]] via that.
