I'm unsure how it's taken me so long to add Ruby's website to my bookmarks but it's here now! I know Ruby from the brief encounters we have had on the [[32-Bit Cafe]] discord server. I have visited this website several times this year and always enjoy seeing what new page they have added. 

My two favourite recent additions are the following blog posts [88x31 buttons I've made](https://www.bruh.ltd/blog/88x31-buttons-ive-made/) and [Archetypes of website navigation](https://www.bruh.ltd/blog/archetypes-of-website-navigation/); the former because I have an affinity for the 88x31 button format and enjoyed reading the history behind their buttons and the latter because it's genuinely interesting.
