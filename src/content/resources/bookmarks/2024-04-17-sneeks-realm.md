Found via the [out links page](https://hillhouse.neocities.org/links) of [[Rosemary's Website]] I first clicked through because Sneek's 88x31 button stood out as interesting, I was very happy that I did because their website is the kind of aesthetic that I love!

While not as large, nor as sprawling as some of the personal websites I have linked in my bookmarks, Sneek's realm feels nice and cozy and has more than enough pages to explore.

[Sneek's changelog](https://sneekrealm.neocities.org/changelog/) is one of my favourite pages, I recently had a discussion with [[Trevor Morris's Website|Tevor]] on Mastodon about this kind of page after which they went on to create [their own](https://www.trovster.com/changelog).
