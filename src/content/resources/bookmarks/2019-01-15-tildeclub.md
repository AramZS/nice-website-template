I first learned of ~tilde clubs in 2017 or 2018 after reading Paul Fords 2014 article [I had a couple drinks and woke up with 1,000 nerds](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf), in the years since (I am writing this in 2024, the concept is now a decade old) I have seen multiple tilde clubs pop up while the original by Paul grow from strength to strength.

It's a scene I have often wanted to dip my toes into and actually thinking about it, I am surprised that I never did.
