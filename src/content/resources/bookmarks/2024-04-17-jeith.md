I visited Jeith's website because their 88x31 button looked interesting, immediately seeing spot the dog meant this was a good decision. The homepage doesn't autoplay music, or at least it didn't when I first visited. However, every other page appears to.

This is one of my favourite websites that I have visited recently and their [resources](https://jeith.neocities.org/resources) page linking to dozens of other incredible websites sent me down a deep [[Rabbit Hole]]!
