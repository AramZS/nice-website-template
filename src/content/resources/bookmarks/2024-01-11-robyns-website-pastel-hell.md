I find beauty in minimalism and yet this website with its bright, happy colours and many pixel art graphics should be the antithesis of all that I like. However, much in the way that I both enjoy and appreciate both death metal _and_ an  orchestral rendition of FÃ¼r Elise I find beauty in Robyn's Website. 

Nostalgia has something to do with it, this website invokes happy memories of my early years browsing from one pixel artists website to another; each designed in a similar way to Robyns.
