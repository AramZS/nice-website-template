Whenever someone follows me on Mastodon I check their profile to see if they have a website for me to browse and Trevor's did not disappoint! Their website, or rather _digital garden_ feels much like my own. They have collections for the films and books they have enjoyed as well as a growing links list.

My favourite section of their website so far is their [activities tracking](https://www.trovster.com/activities) page, the bike selection at the bottom of the page is very cool!
