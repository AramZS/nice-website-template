I saw the unique 88x31 button for this webpage on the homepage of [[RAINS SPACE]], I'm not sure _what_ it is about the button that appeals to the [[Digital Magpie]] deep within me and I felt a strong compulsion to add it to my own button board. Unfortunately, the webpage it links to is dead and I never got to visit it personally therefore I can only imagine what wonders it held within.
