Discovered via the favourites page of [[Pzuraq, Kristen's Blog]] and I am very glad that I did. Not only does their website have some very interesting content, but they have also published several books. I was excited by their preface to both [Ra](https://qntm.org/ra) and [Fine Structure](https://qntm.org/structure) that I impulse purchased both in paperback.

I quite enjoyed their article [So You Want To Abolish Time Zones](https://qntm.org/abolish) and have been inspired by their section [30 First Drafts](https://qntm.org/nanowrimo) to do similar here.
