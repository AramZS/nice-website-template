This webring by [[coffeebug's website|coffeebug]] has a very nice design for displaying its members, with each member having an apartment in a virtual high rise. This means that there are limited _rooms_ for members to occupy. 

> When we reach 48 members, I'll expand the building.

When I first came across this project I wondered if the height of the virtual building was set in stone and quite liked the idea that over time old members _moving out_ as their websites succumb to [[ digital entropy ]], however it does appear the intent is to expand the building as it reaches capacity.
