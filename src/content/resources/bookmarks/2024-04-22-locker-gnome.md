I saw the 88x31 button for this website in the footer of [[Boodle Box]] and thought it would make a nice addition to my button collection. 

Interestingly; while the Locker Gnome website appears to have entered the internets digital graveyard the domain lives on taking you to [Chris Pirillo Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/chrispirillo/about).
