I enjoy a good [Windows 98 aesthetic,](/lists/windows-interface/) or I guess it's called retro wave now? In any case Jay's website is fun to explore. I very much like the layout of their [gallery page](https://nenrikido.neocities.org/gallery/); this is something I would like to add to my website in some form.
