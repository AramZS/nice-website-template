Created as a parody of [LinkExchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkExchange) as part of [[Boodle Box]] this piece of digital entertainment aims to provide you nothing of value for free and I, for one, love free stuff!

I have an essay in the works (it's been a while, I think I started it in 2021!) on banner exchanges of the early 2000s of which LinkExchange was the biggest I knew of. It was nice to find this parody of that network.
