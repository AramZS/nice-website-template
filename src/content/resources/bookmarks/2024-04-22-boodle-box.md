Providing such useful content as [Fake Awards for Your Website](https://boodlebox.neocities.org/award2) and [Software Button Parodies](https://boodlebox.neocities.org/award3) the Boodle Box doesn't quite have it all, but it has enough to keep you entertained for maybe five minutes and _maybe_ has something of interest that you would like to add to your own personal website to give it a bit of whimsy.

My favourite section is [[The Internet Blink Exchange]], with the Software Button Parodies being a close second.
