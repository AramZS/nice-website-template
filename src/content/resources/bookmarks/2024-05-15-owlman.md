I'm really glad I stumbled across OwlMan's Website because it's full of incredible pages such as [their who's who ASCII art](https://owlman.neocities.org/ascii), listing the authors of ASCII art they have used on their website but also acting as an incredible portal into the world of ASCII artists!

I found this website via their website hosted at [[NeoZones]].
